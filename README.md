## About the Novel
*Tsukiyo no Sentaku* is a short *one-shot* visual novel that follows the intertwined fates of two main characters: **Ren**, the male protagonist, and **Miya**, the female protagonist and his childhood friend.  

Players will explore their story through branching choices, while writing responses in real time and experiencing Miya’s unique reactions. Every decision shapes the future, leading to different outcomes.
There's a total of 3 endings to discover and infinite possibilites of dialogues, experiment how much you want and immerse yourself while doing so!

## Contributing
We are currently **not accepting any code contributions nor grammatical reviews**. But, if you want to translate Tsukiyo to any other language, feel free to open a PR with your translations!
We are looking for official Japanese translations.

If you are interested in learning more about our **LLM system** or exploring a more generalized use-case version of it, please refer to the section below.

## LLM System
The **LLM system** was developed by our programmer **Rain**, inspired by the system originally created by Zeeblo for a *Doki Doki Literature Club* mod. While that implementation is now dated and limited due to older LLM constraints, our system aims to deliver a better and concise result overall.

Through real-time interaction, players can write their own responses and receive dynamic reactions via **dialogue, imagery, music, and sound effects**. For Tsukiyo, currently there's only dialogue and image receivers from the A.I.

- The system is built on **OpenAI’s API**, as it attends all of our necessities and have Deepseek compatibility too. In the future, this may be changed for the GLM model api integration.  
- The AI is capable of generating responses not only for the **narrator, Ren, and Miya**, but also of selecting appropriate images to reflect the current context. One of our future objectives is it to be able to play specific SFX, play effects and even custom BGM to match the scene appropriately.

More details and documentation will be shared in the **original repository**: *TBA*.
