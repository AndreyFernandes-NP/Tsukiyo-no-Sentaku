## Contributing
We are currently **not accepting external contributions**.  
This may change depending on the project’s development stage.  

If you are interested in learning more about our **LLM system** or exploring a more generalized use-case version of it, please refer to the section below.

## LLM System
The **LLM system** was developed by our programmer **Rain**, inspired by the system originally created by Zeeblo for a *Doki Doki Literature Club* mod. While that implementation is now dated and limited due to older LLM constraints, our system aims to push immersion to the next level.

Through real-time interaction, players can write their own responses and receive dynamic reactions via **dialogue, imagery, music, and sound effects**.  

- The system is built on **OpenAI’s API**, optimized for the lowest latency possible.
- It adapts writing style to match our narrative design, ensuring consistency with the story.  
- The AI is capable of generating responses not only for the **narrator, Ren, and Miya**, but also of selecting appropriate images and dynamically choosing the soundtrack to reflect the current context.  

More details and documentation will be shared in the **original repository**: *TBA*.
