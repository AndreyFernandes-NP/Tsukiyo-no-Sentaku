## Contributing
We are not accepting contributions, even though this novel can/can't be ready at the time you're reading this. If you're interested on learning about our LLM system and a better/general use case version of it, see the section below.

## LLM System
The LLM system is a technology developed by our programmer Rain, it's based on the famous system made by Zeeblo with its Doki Doki literature club implementation. While his system is currently dated now and limited because of old LLM problem, ours aim to improve immersion while playing in absurdly levels, by in real time you writing your own responses and getting reactions through Images, Sounds, Music and most importantly, dialogues.
We use an OpenAI API based system to generate everything in real time with the lowest latency possible, while also getting the best response and writing based on our writer's one. The AI can not only generate responses as the narrator, Ren and Miya, but select images and even decide the mood by choosing which song to transition for depending on the context, as it matters a lot to us.
